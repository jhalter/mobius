# Mobius

Mobius is a cross-platform command line [Hotline](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline_Communications) client and server implemented in Golang.

The goal of Mobius server is to make it simple to run a Hotline server on macOS, Linux, and Windows, with full compatibility for all popular Hotline clients.

The goal of the Mobius client is to make it fun and easy to connect to multiple Hotline servers through a [cool retro terminal UI](https://github.com/jhalter/mobius/wiki/Mobius-Client-Screenshot-Gallery).

## Getting started

### Docker

### Docker

To quickly run a Hotline server with ports forwarded from the host OS to the container, run:

	docker run --rm -p 5500:5500 -p 5501:5501 ghcr.io/jhalter/mobius:latest

You can now connect to localhost:5500 with your favorite Hotline client and play around, but all changes will be lost on container restart.

To serve files from the host OS and persist configuration changes, you'll want to set up a [bind mount](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/) that maps a directory from the host into the container.

To do this, create a directory in a location of your choice on the host OS.  For clarity, we'll assign the path to the `HLFILES` environment variable and re-use it:

```
export HLFILES=/home/myuser/hotline-files
mdkir $HLFILES

sudo docker run \
    --pull=always \
    --rm \
    -p 5500:5500 \
    -p 5501:5501 \
    -v $HLFILES:/usr/local/var/mobius/config \
    ghcr.io/jhalter/mobius:latest \
    -init
```

It's a good security practice to run your server as a non-root user, which also happens to make editing the configuration files easier from the host OS.

To do this, add the `--user` flag to the docker run arguments with a user ID and group ID of a user on the host OS.

`--user 1001:1001`

You'll now find a configuration directory on your host OS populated with a default configuration:

```
‚ùØ ls -al $HLFILES
total 32
drwxr-xr-x   8 jhalter  staff   256 Jun 12 17:11 .
drwxr-x---+ 49 jhalter  staff  1568 Jun 12 17:11 ..
-rw-r--r--   1 jhalter  staff    38 Jun 12 17:11 Agreement.txt
drwxr-xr-x   3 jhalter  staff    96 Jun 12 17:11 Files
-rw-r--r--   1 jhalter  staff    19 Jun 12 17:11 MessageBoard.txt
-rw-r--r--   1 jhalter  staff    15 Jun 12 17:11 ThreadedNews.yaml
drwxr-xr-x   4 jhalter  staff   128 Jun 12 17:11 Users
-rw-r--r--   1 jhalter  staff   313 Jun 12 17:11 config.yaml
```

Edit `config.yaml` to get started personalizing your server.

### Mac OS

For Mac OS the easiest path to installation is through Homebrew.

#### Client

To install the client:

    brew install jhalter/mobius-hotline-client/mobius-hotline-client

Then run `mobius-hotline-client` to get started.

#### Server

To install the server:

    brew install jhalter/mobius-hotline-server/mobius-hotline-server

After installation `mobius-hotline-server` will be installed at `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/bin/mobius-hotline-server` and should be in your $PATH.

The server config file directory is under `$HOMEBREW_PREFIX/var/mobius` which by default contains:

    /opt/homebrew/mobius/config/MessageBoard.txt
    /opt/homebrew/var/mobius/config/config.yaml
    /opt/homebrew/var/mobius/config/ThreadedNews.yaml
    /opt/homebrew/var/mobius/config/Agreement.txt
    /opt/homebrew/var/mobius/config/Users/guest.yaml
    /opt/homebrew/var/mobius/config/Users/admin.yaml

Edit `/usr/local/var/mobius/config/config.yaml` to change your server name and other settings.

Edit `/usr/local/var/mobius/config/Agreement.txt` to set your server agreement.

Run `mobius-hotline-server -help` for usage options.

### Linux

Download a compiled release for your architecture from the Releases page or follow build from source instructions

### Windows

    TODO

### Build from source

To build from source, run:

    make all

Then grab your desired build from `dist`
